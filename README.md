# React Shopper Boilerplate
This project is a simple React boilerplate to get you started -- feel free to
either create your own client app or eject the app, but you must have some
form of formal state management (React Contexts, Redux, etc).

## Purpose
This application is an example of an app with sufficient state management, decoupling
of network calls, and how React hooks and functional components work.

You may decide to rewrite the app, or write future components, in class; all the power
to you!

## Goals
You should attempt to achieve 15 points on this project by following the below
schema...

However, you may decide to add your own features to the app that may compensate
for points if they prove you have learned a part of the technology and are relevant
to the stack that your team will be working with.

If you decide to take that route, please confirm with the TA or professor first.

Your points can be combined with those goals of the [backend](https://github.com/USFClassrooms/Shopper-API).

| Points | Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Development Setup
You'll first need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, however I recommend
installing it through [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) as it provides
a great way to switch between projects' node versions automatically and may
come in handy with your own sponsors' projects.

### Installing Nodenv
The easiest way to install nodenv is through [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/).
```bash
brew install nodenv
```

and then place the following into your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc` or
whatever file your shell sources:
```bash
eval "$(nodenv init -)"
```

If you have any questions, see the [nodenv installation guide](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv).

You'll then want to install the node version listed in `.node-version` at the
root of this project:
```bash
cd animal-colony-frontend
nodenv install
```

### Installing the Required Dependencies
Node.js comes pre-installed with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), and we
use it to sync packages for the project.

To install the dependencies do
```bash
cd animal-colony-frontend
npm install
```

### Starting the App
You'll notice there are `scripts` in the `package.json` file, these
are shorthand commands that you can also define to help accomplish
tasks that you run frequently.

You can start up the app with
```bash
npm start
```

and you'll notice the app begins to listen on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
and has hot-reloading built in!  You won't need to manually start up the app
every time you make a change, what a world we live in...

### Configuring the Backend
The backend is stored as a separate project, and will need to be started
in a separate shell.  Find the setup instructions on the
[Shopper-API](https://github.com/USFClassrooms/Shopper-API) project page.
